I'm currently a postdoctoral fellow of the [Chicago Center for Theoretical Chemistry](https://cctch.uchicago.edu/) at the University of Chicago. I do computational and theoretical research on soft active matter systems in the groups of [Suri Vaikuntanathan](https://chemistry.uchicago.edu/faculty/suri-vaikuntanathan-0) and [Aaron Dinner](https://chemistry.uchicago.edu/faculty/aaron-dinner).  

Before coming to Chicago, I received a Ph.D. from the University of Maryland where I was mentored by [Garyk Papoian](https://papoian.chem.umd.edu/) and [Chris Jarzynski](https://chem.umd.edu/people/christopher-jarzynski).  While there, I helped to develop the software package [MEDYAN](https://medyan.org/download.html) for agent-based simulations of cytoskeletal self-organization.
